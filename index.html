    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      <b> I am located in Queens, New York and have always had a passion for fashion. As environmental factors kept
        declining I saw a huge environmental gap in fashion. When the pandemic hit, I realized how much sustainable
        fashion could be. I knew I wanted to upcycle clothing so people would be less likely to discard their
        clothing, but before that I woud have to learn to sew and understand peoples wardobes so I started with
        styling. Of course I wanted to make it a sustainable option so I offered newly thrifted wardobes as a choice
        for clients. While getting accepted to an AgTech program, one of the things we learned about was Mushrooms
        and their capabilities in decomposing waste. I knew I wanted to be apart of that solution and incorporate
        Mushrooms into fashion. Mushrooms could be used to decompose many fabrics that are not organic. </b>

    <h2>Agriculture</h2>

    <p>

      <b>In the first week we have been learning about sustainable food systems and what makes them sustainable such as
        environmental, economic,and social sustainability.We then discussed Closed Loop Agriculture such as
        Hydroponics,the process for growing plants without soil and
        Aquaponics, the process of growing hydroponic produce.This week we covered Biomimicry, which mimics nature in
        the objects and systems humans design.
        We also went more in dept into Hydroponics and Aquaponics. We discussed the different starter sysytems such
        as:the Kratky Method, Deep Water Culture, and Wick Method. Also, Built Sysytems:NFT, F&D, and Drip System.
        As for Aquaponics we learned more about The Aquaponic Cycle and how fish, their waste, the bacteria of their
        waste is used for food for plants. Learning about mushrooms was my favorite lesson. We learned about the common
        types of growing mediums for mushrooms, such as: wood, straw , manure, recycled paper, brewers waste, coffee
        Grounds, waste from food processing. As well as the six steps of mushroom cultivation: composting,
        pastuerization, spawning, casing, pinning, and cropping. We also went over lighting systems. Light spectrum
        refers to the broad wavelengths of raditation produced by the
        sun or artificial lights. And why it's important for plants, because they can only utilize certain parts of this
        spectrum. </b>

    </p>

    <p>

      <b>In third week, we also learned about DIY farm materials. Everything from safe plastics that are generally safe
        for hydroponic use. Such as: food grade plastics and plastics #2,#4,#5. We reviewed examples of low, medium,
        highcost DIY options for hydroponic systems.Some low cost systems include, prefabricated options like: Deep
        Water culture bins and bucket Kits. Examples of medium cost systems are prefabricated options such as NFT
        systems and smaller tabletop systems and DIY options like: small NFT Systems, Drip Systems, and Bato Bucket
        Systems. Highcost Systems examples are prefabricated options like Larger Home Systems and DIY options like
        Aeroponic Bins,
        Larger NFT, Larger Flood and Drain, and Larger Drip Systems. We also went over items used for hydroponic
        plumbing: PVC, cPVC, uPVC being the safest choice.</b>

    <h2>Technology</h>
    <p>
      <b>In Technology week 1, we learned about the structure of HTML, how to create a standard HTML Document, and CSS.
        We also used Figma to create our Wireframe and saw how our website design will look once completed.The following
        week we used GitHub which stores changes between version of the code you're creating. </b>

    </p>

    <p>

      <b> In week 3 we were introduced to Javascript. We learned about Javascript Operators that compute values such as:
        + addition, -subtraction, *multiplication, / division, %modulo. Variables can make programs easier to write,
        read, and understand. They are containers for storing data values. We learned that in order to create a variable
        you have to use the keyword var, let, or const. We then covered Functions and how they are blocks of code
        designed to preforms a particular task when “something” calls it. In week four, we covered Conditionals, Loops,
        Arrays, and Objects. </b>

    <h2>Lab</h2>

    <p>

      <b>In week 1, we were introduced to Food Systems. A food system is a complex combination of factors involved in or
        linked to the production and consumption of food by a population. The following week we covered digital designs.
        In week 4 we went over the materials list for our farms. I am growing Mushrooms and decided on doing a Martha
        Grow Tent. In week 4 we went over a Farm Planning Template. Growing conditions, light requirements, and grow
        area information were also discussed.</b>

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p>

      <b>In Construction we learned how to construct garden beds. We also learned about the different tools such as a
        shortstop, saw, and powerdrill we used to construct the garden beds. The following time we met we went over
        hammers & bars, wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, saws& cutters, and clamps. We identified and discussed various
        hammers and bars, such as: a ball peen hammer, claw hammer, framing hammer, masonry hammer, a flat bar, and a
        wrecking bar. We then identified and discussed wrenches such as: open ended wrench, box end wrench, combination
        wrench, pipe wrench, adjustable wrench, spud
        wrench, and socket wrench. We then identified and discussed screwdrivers, such as: Phillips
        screwdriver,Robertson screwdriver, torx screwdriver, clutch screwdriver. Then, we identified and discussed
        pliers, such as: slip joint pliers, long nose pliers, locking pliers, tongue and groove pliers, linesman pliers,
        and wire strippers. Saw and cutters were then identified and discussed, such as: a back saw, a rip saw, cross
        cut saw, hack saw, coping saw, and a drywall saw. Some clamps that were identified and used were bar
        clamps, spring clamps, and locking clamp.</b>
